# 🐳 Dockerfile – Definition
# A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image.

# It defines everything needed to set up an environment inside a container — such as:

# base operating system or language (e.g., node, ubuntu)

# dependencies to install

# source code to copy

# build commands to run

# and the default command to start the app


# 🔧 In short:
# A Dockerfile automates the process of creating Docker images.

# Use official Node.js LTS image as base
FROM node:18

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only package files to install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the app (for production-ready apps like Next.js or React)
RUN npm run build

# Expose port (default for Next.js/React is 3000)
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
